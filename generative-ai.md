## Kubernetes (k8s)
* Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.
* Virtualized deployment era:
  * Each VM is a full machine running all the components, including its own operating system, on top of the virtualized hardware.
* Container deployment era:
  * Containers are similar to VMs, but they have relaxed isolation properties to share the Operating System (OS) among the applications.
    Therefore, containers are considered lightweight.
  * 与传统的虚拟机不同，容器共享主机操作系统的内核，因此更加高效和便携。
