## Kubernetes (k8s)
* Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.
* Virtualized deployment era:
  * Each VM is a full machine running all the components, including its own operating system, on top of the virtualized hardware.
* Container deployment era:
  * Containers are similar to VMs, but they have relaxed isolation properties to share the Operating System (OS) among the applications.
    Therefore, containers are considered lightweight.
  * 与传统的虚拟机不同，容器共享主机操作系统的内核，因此更加高效和便携。

## DeepSeek
### DeepSeek-VL2
* https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-VL2
* a strong Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model
* 236B total parameters, 21B are activated for each token,  context length of 128K tokens
* innovative architectures
  * Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)
    * MLA guarantees efficient inference through significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector
  * DeepSeekMoE
    * enables training strong models at an economical cost through sparse computation
  * v.s. DeepSeek 67B:
    * significantly stronger performance
    * saves 42.5% of training costs
    * reduces the KV cache by 93.3%
    * boosts the maximum generation throughput to 5.76 times
  * pretrain: on a high-quality and multi-source corpus consisting of 8.1T tokens
  * Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)

1. Introduction
* we introduce MLA, an attention mechanism equipped with low-rank key-value joint compression.
  Empirically, MLA achieves superior performance compared with MHA, significantly reduces the KV cache during inference, thus boosting the inference efficiency.
* For Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), we follow the DeepSeekMoE architecture (Dai et al., 2024), which adopts
  fine-grained expert segmentation and shared expert isolation for higher potential in expert specialization 
* We construct a high-quality and multi-source pre-training corpus consisting of 8.1T tokens.
* DeepSeek-V2 Chat (SFT): we collect 1.5M conversational sessions, which encompass various domains such as math, code, 
  writing, reasoning, safety, and more, to perform Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)  
* DeepSeek-V2 Chat (RL): Finally, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to further align the model with
  human preference
